## Bivariate Normal Explorer 
###  by Rafael Espericueta

This shiny application allows one to explore the bivariate normal distribution.
The user may specify the number of samples from a bivariate normal distribution with standard deviations sx and sy, and with correlation coefficient r.  A sample of variables with this distribution is displayed, along with a regression line fit to that data.
